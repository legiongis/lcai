		  <p class="g-color-black">There are various perspectives from which to approach the question of rock art’s meaning. One meaning is the cultural significance rock art has for contemporary Native Americans, as an expression of their long tenure on the land and their connection with their ancestors and spirit beings of the world. From an archaeological perspective, meaning is reconstructing the role rock art played in prehistoric societies. </p>
			
		  <p class="g-color-black">Although rock art is a system of communication (but not writing), trying to recover specific interpretations placed upon it by its makers and users is not possible without insider commentary. For prehistoric cultures, there is no insider commentary to tell us about rock art’s original “meaning.” Even with indigenous commentary, as among African or Australian indigenous communities, social anthropology shows that art has multiple symbolic meanings contingent on context. The same design may mean different things to different people depending on their age, sex, and social position. It often may have different meanings for the same person at various stages of life. For archaeology, explaining rock art is about understanding the ways that people used rock art in their cultural lives, as its original meanings cannot be recovered.</p>
			  
		  <p class="g-color-black">One thing that rock art makes clear is that prehistoric cultural attitudes to the landscape were not solely based on economic considerations. Ethnographically, Great Basin peoples recognized supernatural power as distributed in patterned ways across the landscape and as potentially residing in animals, plants, or other natural objects. It is unlikely that prehistoric populations conceived of the landscape as culturally neutral. Rock art, as it serves no obvious “utilitarian” purpose, seems to represent places that were important to visit for mainly social or cultural reasons. Although widespread, rock art only marks a fraction of the environment used by prehistoric populations. It is strongly associated with logistical campsites and economic activity areas away from village or aggregation sites. Even very dense concentrations of rock art are frequently associated with comparatively slight habitation debris. Prehistoric rock art is not the casual byproduct of other economic activities in its vicinity, otherwise most campsites and work areas would also have been accompanied by rock art. </p>

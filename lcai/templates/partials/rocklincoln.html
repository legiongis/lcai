				<p class="g-mb-30">The general pattern of a strong association between rock art and logistical camps is illustrated well in Lincoln County. The area was settled by hunter-gatherers for most of prehistory but borders Late Archaic Fremont and Western Puebloan cultural developments, with a brief Fremont presence in the eastern half of the county. Approximately 200 prehistoric rock art sites have been identified in the county, concentrated in the west-central half of the county in the Pahranagat Valley area and, in the east, along the Meadow Valley Wash drainage. Two-thirds of sites are small concentrations of rock art (fewer than 15 rock art panels) and cover a small area. The largest sites and major rock concentrations are in the west in the areas of Badger Valley, Pahranagat Valley, and Sixmile Flat. Rock art spans the Archaic and Late Prehistoric, but based on themes in the art and the age of associated archaeological features, most rock art sites seem to belong to the Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. </p>

					  <p>Basin and Range tradition is the most common rock art style in Lincoln County and is generally representative of its broader Great Basin expression. Abstract designs account for approximately 80% of all rock art imagery in the county and co-occurs with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery throughout the county. Thousands of curvilinear and rectilinear motif types are represented in Lincoln County rock art; curvilinear motifs are the most abundant type, making up 31% of all individual motifs, while rectilinear and simple linear combined make up 25% of all designs. Circles, bisected circles, concentric circles, circles connected in a line, and circles with external radial lines are by far the most common curvilinear motif types (44% of all curvilinear types) and resemble closely the form and relative abundance of similar designs in other regions of the Great Basin. Rectilinear designs most commonly take the form of rectangles and rake-like forms (two-thirds of all rectilinear motif types) and are more prominent in the county than their counterparts in the northern Great Basin. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p class="g-mb-30">Portrayals of bighorn sheep make up 10% of all rock art designs found and are much more frequent than portrayals of people. Bighorn sheep images are widely distributed but are more abundant in the western half of the county. Here, large concentrations in the Badger Valley and Mount Irish areas have hundreds of bighorn sheep figures, typified by sites adjacent Red Pigment Canyon/Shooting Gallery III and Paiute Rocks. Away from these two areas, bighorn sheep figures generally occur in small numbers (five or fewer) at sites. Only a limited range of other animal species are portrayed, usually in small numbers, principally coyotes, deer, and ambiguous serpentine lines that might be schematized snakes. Overall, Lincoln County’s rock art is representative of the Great Basin preference for rock art dominated by abstract imagery with bighorn sheep as the main animal depicted. However, zoomorphic imagery is more prominent (and abundant) in the county’s rock art assemblages than those in the central and northern Great Basin. </p>
				
				<p class="g-mb-30">Anthropomorphs account for about 5% of the county’s rock art designs, with Fremont style, Pahranagat style, and stick-figure anthropomorphs occurring in roughly equal numbers. Stick-figure anthropomorphs are widely distributed but their Fremont and Pahranagat style counterparts are localized in their distribution. </p>

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-9 g-mb-30">
					  <p>The Pahranagat Anthropomorph Style is unique to Lincoln County and comprises two distinct variants; one a headless (usually) pattern-body anthropomorph (PBA) and the other with a solid-pecked body. The PBA variant is rectangular in form, internally decorated (with grids, dots, or geometric motifs) and “fringed” by short vertical lines. This type often lacks a head but has stick-figure legs and short arms that sometimes hold an atlatl-like object. The second type has a solid-pecked oval or rectangular body, large eyes (indicated by using negative space), and a line protruding from the head; the arms are portrayed down-turned and with long fingers. This anthropomorph style is known from about 27 sites ranging from the Delamar Mountains in the south, White River Narrows in the north, Mount Irish in the west, and Kane Springs Canyon to the east. It only occurs in large numbers (over 60 figures) at two sites in Pahranagat Valley and nearby Delamar Valley. About 220 PBAs are known compared to about 60 solid-body types. </p>
				      <p>This style is dated to the Middle and Late Archaic because nearly a third of PBAs are portrayed holding what appears to be an atlatl and the major Pahranagat style sites are associated with archaeological materials that span the Middle Archaic through the Late Prehistoric. The landscape settings of most known sites appear to have been most intensively used for seasonal campsites by small groups that had dispersed from large villages. This rock art style has continuing cultural significance for contemporary Numic peoples in the region. </p>

				<p class="g-mb-30">Fremont anthropomorphs are concentrated in the eastern half of the county in Meadow Valley Wash and upper Kane Springs. These belong to the Sevier style and have triangular or trapezoidal torsos, and triangular or rectangular heads, made as either petroglyphs (at open sites) or pictographs (in rockshelters). Fremont anthropomorphs occur in small numbers, rarely exceeding 10 at a site. Fremont work parties making forays from larger Fremont village sites to the north and east made these small rock art sites. Either they were made while carrying out other resource procurement activities or represent expeditions to visit culturally significant places located in areas otherwise peripheral to Fremont settlement activities. </p>
				<p class="g-mb-30">The Basin and Range tradition component of Lincoln County’s rock art is associated with archaeological materials that span the Middle Archaic through the Late Prehistoric. These rock art sites generally co-occur with evidence of relative minor economic activities, foraging and resource processing, or short-term campsites. The latter were the locus for a wide range of hunting and foraging activities and were used by social groups ranging in size from specialized foraging or hunting parties to a small number of family households. These foraging and hunting expeditions were made to take advantage of seasonally available resources (economic and cultural) as environmental conditions permitted. Rock art indicates that certain places in the landscape had a cultural significance despite the economic costs of visiting and using such places. Although enigmatic, rock art does show that social practices and beliefs played some role in shaping how cultures categorized their environment and its resources, much like ethnographic Great Basin peoples. </p>

				<p class="g-mb-30">Styles of rock art are identified by considering how artists made it and what they chose to portray. The choices that prehistoric artists made were constrained by their cultural beliefs. Artists are not free to portray whatever they like however they want. Cultural beliefs establish what subjects can be portrayed and how these are to be depicted. In most cultures artists select from a set of styles depending on context. Art that portrays everyday life tends to be stylistically different from those depicting ceremonial themes. For example, in parts of Australia, rock paintings portraying ancestral beings are stylistically very different from rock art made by the same artists for the purposes of sorcery. The former are very formal and carefully made, in contrast to the more elemental rock paintings made for sorcery.</p>
			  
				<p class="g-mb-30">Archaeologists try to assign different styles to specific periods and relate them to known archaeological cultures. But archaeologists recognize that it is not straightforward to attribute specific rock art styles with individual archaeological cultures. Individual cultures usually have several styles of art that are used for different purposes, similar to having different styles of ceramic vessels for different functions. Styles of art and artifacts are also the result of cultural and social practices that may be shared by different cultures (such as the Ghost Dance movement). </p>
			

			 	<p class="g-mb-30">Great Basin rock art ranges from abstract designs to schematic representations that closely resemble people or animals (“representational” designs). Abstract motif types predominate throughout the region. These are difficult to separate into individual styles because their shapes are often very similar. Individual styles are most easily recognized by identifying the different choices made by artists in what themes to portray and in how to depict those themes (form and method). The best-defined Great Basin rock art styles, therefore, are based on distinctive stylistic treatments of people and animals.</p>

					  <p>Circular depressions, usually a few centimeters wide and deep, pecked or ground on boulders are called cupules or the Pit-and-groove style. These are very distinctive in appearance and were once believed to be the earliest Great Basin rock art style. At Grimes Point (western Nevada), cupules on basalt boulders have been coated by patina so dark (and therefore old) that they are very hard to see. Cupules are not abundant in the Great Basin and are also found in association with Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric archaeological remains, indicating that they cannot be assumed to always be of great antiquity.</p>

					  <h3 class="h4 g-color-black g-font-weight-600">Basin and Range Tradition</h3>
					  <p>The abundant curvilinear and rectilinear abstract designs found throughout the Great Basin culture area are called either Basin and Range tradition or Western Archaic Tradition. Curvilinear motifs comprise a wide variety of circular designs (such as concentric circles, connected circles, spirals, dots, etc.), curvilinear meanders, and serpentine lines. Rectilinear motifs comprise grids, rectangles, rakes, cross-hatching, etc. Only a limited range of animal species are portrayed in Great Basin rock art. By far the most common zoomorphic theme is bighorn sheep, with other mammals and reptiles portrayed in small numbers.</p>
						<p>Curvilinear motifs usually predominate, accompanied by rectilinear motifs, smaller numbers of stick-figure anthropomorphs, and a narrow range of animal species. Basin and Range tradition rock art spans the Archaic and the Late Prehistoric (8,000-150 years ago) and is strongly associated with Archaic hunter-gatherer cultures in the Desert West. It is a less prominent component of anthropomorph styles associated with Fremont and Western Puebloan groups in the region. </p>

					  <p>The best-defined styles are distinctive styles of anthropomorphs and bighorn sheep, and mostly developed during the Late Archaic. These “representational” styles, with the exception of the Coso and Pahranagat Anthropomorph Styles, are typically associated with Fremont and Western Puebloan cultures (ca. 2,000-750 years ago) in southeastern Nevada (including Lincoln County), Utah, and the Colorado Plateau. These semi-horticultural groups made rock art that included stylized anthropomorphs that share common attributes of trapezoidal, rectangular, or triangular body shapes. These were often portrayed with bodily decoration such as headgear, jewelry, or decorated clothing. </p>
						<p>Anthropomorphs with similar attributes were also made by Archaic hunter-gatherers in southeastern Nevada and the Cosos (eastern California). The Pahranagat anthropomorph style is broadly contemporaneous with Fremont and Western Puebloan rock art styles, though its origins lie in the Middle Archaic. The age of Coso style rock art is poorly defined, but appears to be concentrated in the Middle Archaic. A general evolutionary sequence is apparent that stylized anthropomorphs seem to be a later development, with the exception of the Coso style. </p>
						<p>Rock art found in Sevier Fremont territory (western Utah but extending into eastern Nevada and fairly well-represented in Lincoln County) is the most schematic or stylized of these anthropomorph styles. It comprises triangular and trapezoidal anthropomorphs, usually lacking legs, sometimes with arms, and often with headgear and ear decoration, made as pictographs or petroglyphs. At their most schematic, these are trapezoid outlines that closely resemble the shape of Fremont clay figurines. </p>	
						<p>To the south and bordering Lincoln County, Western Puebloan groups made distinctive rock art (West Virgin Kayenta style) in western Utah, the Valley of Fire and lower Moapa Valley, Nevada. These Western Puebloan rock art anthropomorphs have triangular, rectangular, or hour-glass shaped bodies, sometimes with “horns” or headgear. Most of these formal attributes are characteristic of Fremont anthropomorph styles though their visual appearance is somewhat different. This suggests that cultural practices and knowledge distinctive to Fremont or Western Puebloan peoples did occasionally cross cultural boundaries. Alternatively, the anthropomorphic traditions of both cultures may represent variations on shared cultural practices that symbolized social status through public presentation of self and manifested in rock art.  </p>	
						<p>Both cultures were experiencing far-reaching economic, social, and settlement changes—i.e., the development of horticulture, reduced mobility, and resulting increases in population, more permanent villages, perhaps greater social stratification, and sporadic social conflict. The stylized anthropomorphs of these cultures may have represented new social positions and statuses that arose from economic and settlement changes, as well as being used in social practices aimed at gaining acceptance of these changes by managing social tensions by presenting them through the legitimating lens of symbolic culture.</p>	
						<p>Although the age and cultural affiliation of Lincoln County’s distinctive Pahranagat Anthropomorph Style is somewhat unclear, based on the age of associated archaeological materials, it appears to be Middle and Late Archaic in age. This age range fits with the general pattern of distinctive anthropomorph styles largely being a Late Archaic development </p>

				  <p class="mb-20">For thousands of years, people have inhabited and left their mark on what is now Lincoln County. Prehistoric Native Americans occupied the area as early as 10,000 years ago or more, with multiple groups expressing a variety of regional adaptations over the following centuries. Later groups like the Fremont and Ancestral Puebloan/Virgin Branch Anasazi were centered further east and south, but their reach extended into eastern Nevada and left additional clues behind. Southern Paiutes have occupied Lincoln County for centuries and continue to shape the region today. Explorers, ranchers, farmers, and miners arrived in the 19th century with their own adaptive trends, adding new types of sites and features to the landscape. Today, Lincoln Countyâ€™s archaeological sites are an attraction all their own, seeing visitation by tourists and recreationalists from around the world.</p>
				  
				  <p>To help preserve the rich archaeological heritage of Lincoln County, the BLM has established a number of <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/planning-and-nepa/planning-101/special-planning-designations/acec" title="Learn about ACECs">Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs)</a>. These are areas within existing public lands that require special management to protect significant or endangered resources (among other things). Two of the sites documented as part of the 3D Documentation Pilot Study are part of the Mt. Irish ACEC, and one is part of the Shooting Gallery ACEC. The three pilot sites are also part of the <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/nevada/basin-and-range-national-monument" title="Learn about the Basin and Range National Monument">Basin and Range National Monument.</a></p>

				<p class="g-mb-30">Lincoln County rock art is representative of wider Great Basin rock art traditions, albeit with a distinctive regional expression. The age and purpose of Great Basin rock art are not well understood and determining its age and stylistic evolution is complicated by many factors. Rock art was reused and its locations revisited. Superimpositioning of design elements and discernible differences in the surface patination of designs show that rock art was made and modified episodically over long periods. Some rock art sites appear to have provoked cultural responses over hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. This makes chronologies and evolutionary trends rather generalized.</p>
			  	<p class="g-mb-30">Great Basin and Lincoln County rock art predominantly take the form of petroglyphs. These can rarely be scientifically dated, as they are not usually found in dateable, stratified deposits, and generally lack organic or other materials that can be radiocarbon dated. Pictographs do contain organic or other materials that can be radiocarbon dated. However, taking a sample for radiocarbon dating is destructive. Only in cases where painted material has flaked off its parent rock art panel are such analyses tried. The general lack of scientific dating opportunities means that the age of rock art sites is often estimated by using relative dating methods:</p>

			 	<p class="g-mb-30">Identifying artifacts or themes of known age portrayed in rock art (iconographic analysis) allows a broad estimate of the age of rock art. Only a narrow range of such subjects is portrayed in Great Basin rock art. Anthropomorphs with cowboy hats, or depictions of horses and wagons, for example, are easy to identify as Contact period and historic rock art. Dateable prehistoric themes are generally limited to rare portrayals of projectile points (i.e., dart or arrow points) and, rather more frequent but still statistically minor, the atlatl and the bow. The latter only allow for a broad Middle or Late Archaic age determination (ca. 5,500-700 years ago).</p>

				  <p>Despite the limitations in knowledge of the chronology of much Great Basin rock art, it is clear from contextual evidence that its production and use span the history of human settlement of the Great Basin, albeit concentrated in the Middle and Late Archaic. The oldest site, Winnemucca Lake (northwestern Nevada), is believed to be at least 10,500 years old, and possibly as old as 14,800 years old. It is also the oldest rock art site in North America to be dated by scientific methods. The rock art here was indirectly dated based on the age of carbonate crusts, formed by deep lakes, similar to those overlaying the rock art. The site is believed to have a distinctive style of abstract imagery, the Great Basin Carved Abstract (GBCA). This style comprises deeply pecked designs with wide lines that are densely packed and leave little white or negative space. Other examples of this style are much younger in age. For example, at Massacre Lake (northern Nevada), organic material trapped in patina covering rock art in this style was radiocarbon dated to 4,000-2,900 years ago. </p>

				 <p>Sites such as Winnemucca Lake show that the most ancient rock art sites currently known are in the northern Basin, dating to the earliest phases of the region’s settlement by people. This oldest rock art style (GBCA) is not well represented in Lincoln County, though a small number of examples of this style are known near Kane Springs Valley. In general, rock art appears to become more common over time as populations grew and human settlement expanded to fill most of the Great Basin. Thematic elements such as atlatls and the bow show that many sites probably date to the Middle and Late Archaic (ca. 5,500-700 years ago); historic themes (cowboys and horses) show that some rock art was made around the Contact period. This chronology of rock art is supported by the age of associated archaeological materials at rock art sites, which are most frequently represent settlement debris from Middle and Late Archaic logistical camps and work areas, a pattern shared by Lincoln County.</p>
